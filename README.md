# Sequence Creators Official Website

This is the project for Sequence Creators official website. 
This website is hosted under https://sequencecreators.com/ web address.
Or else, you can find the instructions to run this code in your local environment below.

### Instructions to run the project locally
1. Clone the repository or download the zipped folder.
2. Paste the whole folder in your server folder (XAMPP, MAMP, WAMP, or LAMP)
3. Run the file on localhost. (https://localhost/SQNC-Creators-Website/)
4. You may find the CSS and images are not functioning. If so, please do remove the ../ from all the PHP files from the links that direct to CSS files and image files. (The existing format is the one compatible with the hosting service file manager. But it may not work for localhost)
5. Now you are all set up for debugging.
